Objective: Calculate every student's letter grade of three classes. The grading policy is as
follows: homework and quizzes 30%, two midterms 40% (20% + 20%), final exam (30%).
Standard percentages will be used in determining final letter grade (i.e. 90-100% = A).

The trick part in this project is how to select out the highest 15 out of 18 to 20 times of HW and
quizzes in each class. In other words, a student can drop 3 to 5 homework assignments or
quizzes depending on the class s/he is with.


Besides calculating grade, the following are done:
1. Summary statistics for numerical grade of all students
2. Normality test for numerical grade of all students
3. Frequency table and chart for letter grade of all students
